                <h3>Harvesting</h3>

                <p>Determining when to harvest requires a touch of science along <br> 
                    with old fashioned tasting. Harvesting also heavily depends on the 
                    <br>weather.</p>

             <div class="crushingPressing">

                <h3>Crushing & Pressing</h3>

                <p>Crushing and pressing could be done manually by stomping 
                    <br>the grapes with their feet, or mechanically. Mechanical presses stomp or 
                    <br>trod the grapes into what is called must.</p>

            <div class="fermentation">

                <h3>Fermentation</h3>

                <p>Must (or juice) can begin fermenting naturally within 6-12 <br>
                    hours when aided with wild yeasts in the air.â€ Fermentation continues until 
                    <br>all of the sugar is converted into alcohol and dry wine is produced.</p>

            <div class="clarification">

                <h3>Clarification</h3>

                <p>Clarification is the process in which solids such as dead yeast cells,<br> 
                    tannins, and proteins are removed. Wine can then be clarified <br>
                    through fining or filtration.</p>

            <div class="aging">

                <h3>Aging & Bottling</h3>

                <p>A wine maker has two options: bottle the wine right away or give <br>
                    the wine additional aging. Further aging can be done in the bottles, <br>
                    stainless steel tanks, or oak barrels.</p>
